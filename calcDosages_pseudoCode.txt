Arguments:
1. Name of input file: Tab separated file with genotype probabilities where the first row contains the sample IDs, the following rows have three columns per sample for genotype AA, AB and BB.

2. Optional name of output file

open the input file
open the output file

Read the first line of the input file and print first "SNP" followed by the sample names, tab separated to the output file. This will be the header of the output file

In a for loop from second row of file to end

    Read the next line
    Split the line to a list, by tab
    Store the first element as SNP

    For each value "i" in 2,(2+3*1),(2+3*2),(2+3*3),(2+3*4)... until end of list 

        Calculate dosage as P(AB)+2*P(AA), which will be list_value[i] + 2*list_value[i+1]
        Store in new list

    Make a tab separated string of the list
    Print the dosage string to the output file

close the input file
close the output file
