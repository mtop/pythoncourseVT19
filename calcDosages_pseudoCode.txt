This script will read a VCF file, find the genotype probabilities and use them to calculate dosages
Arguments:
1. Name of input vcf file
2. Optional name of output file

open the vcf file
open the output file

Read the first lines of the vcf file one by one, until read reaches "#CHROM". Print that line as header

In a for loop next line of file to end

    Read the next line
    Split the line to a list (list_a), by whitespace
    Save the first 9 elements in a list (list_b)

    For each value "i" in from index 9 to end of list_a 
    	split the string which is on format GT:GP to extract the three GP (genotype probabilities)
        Calculate dosage as P(AB)+2*P(AA)
        Append to list_b

    Make a tab separated string of list_b
    Print the string to the output file

close the input file
close the output file
