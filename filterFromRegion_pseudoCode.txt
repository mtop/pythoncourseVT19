This script will read a file with i.e. SNP information and filter out the SNPs within a given region of a given chromosome. Either only the SNP name or the SNP name together with annotation.

Input arguments:
- input file: file with SNP information
- chromosome number
- start position of the region
- end position of the region
- flag to decide if only SNP name or with annotation
- optional name of output file (has some default)

open the input file
open the output file

read the first line of the input file
if SNP including annotation should be given
   print the first line to the output file

split the line by whitespace
create a string with each column name followed by the column number separated by commas
print this string and ask for input:
      which is the SNP ID column
      which is the chromosome column
      which is the SNP position column

create variables with the column numbers given above (can have defaults if no answer is given)

loop through the rest of the file
     if args chromosome equals the value in the chromosome column AND args start position is less than the value in the position column AND args end position is greater than the value in the position column
     	if SNP including annotation should be given
	   print the whole line
	else
	   split the line
	   print only the value in the SNP ID column

close the input file
close the output file
